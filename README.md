A gruvboxy / rusted theme for LeftWM.

This theme was originally a modified look of the [arch-one-dark](https://github.com/jamesbaker1901/leftwm-arch-one-dark), this theme is tailored to my wants and needs. I've also taken some colors from the lovely [Alduin](https://github.com/AlessandroYorba/Alduin) colorscheme which I am trying to incorporate the rustic elements from, and from the [everforest](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest). It may take me a while as this is only a side project and not my main one. The polybar config is from [adi1090x](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes) with a few tweaks for my needs. This is still in it's VERY eary stages and expect some non uniformity with colors and such.
